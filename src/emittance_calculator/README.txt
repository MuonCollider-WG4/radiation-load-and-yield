This folder contains the instruction for plotting the emittances of positive muons.

This is not supposed to be a stand-alone program, but rather a collections of useful functions
to be modified as needed. To see the usage, refers to the testing folder.

NOTA BENE: the emittances are calculated assuming x = 0, y = 0 and CZ = 1 as working point.
In case of rototranslation of the frame of reference of the beam, you should take them into account
when calculating the emittance.
